<br>
<h1 style="text-align: center;font-size:120%;000000"><em>Rule Clarifications and Hints</em></h1>


<div style="text-align: center;">
<br> <b>Rules</b>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left;">
	<ul>

	<li>The ruleset of the "REVISED" version of a well known board game are used as a basis.<br><em>TripleA allows only valid moves, so it is possible to start playing without knowing the rules. There are a few exceptions to this, which are listed under "Default Rules" below.</em></li>
	<li>It is possible to play with LHTR style carrier-fighter production/movement rules by checking the carrier-ftr related property in the game options.
	<li>A move illegal using dice is illegal under LL too.<br><em>A move legal using dice is legal under LL too.</em></li>
	<li>Neutrals can be attacked in NWO, no penalties apply.</li>
	<li>Territories can only be strategically bombed up to their value.<br><em>(TTL = Territory Turn Limit)</em></li>
	<li>Only 1 bunker may be placed per territory per turn. Bunkers do not use up factory slots. Territories may have unlimited total bunkers in them. To limit total bunkers to the value of a territory, deselect "Unlimited Constructions". The game options "More Constructions with/without Factory" can be turned off to limit total bunkers to 1 per territory total, in territories with/without Factories.</li>
	</ul>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<br> <b>Default Rules for Disputable Situations</b>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left;">
	<ul>
	<li>Manually (two-step) flying over Neutral territory during combat movement is considered illegal, despite being technically possible.<br><em>(helps balance G2-Paris take)</em>
	<li>Carrier-Ftr movement is handled according to "REVISED" Rules.<br><em>Since the engine does not validate ftr movement completely, this means explicitly: for EVERY Ftr, there has to be a potential landing spot provided, and the Carrier HAS to move into position to provide it, if (and only if) the Ftr survives its battle. Thus, using the Carrier for more then 2 Ftrs or for 2 Ftrs going different directions, requiring different Carrier positions, is NOT allowed - even if LowLuck would guarantee for a Ftr to be lost. It is not allowed to make Ftr movements based on the assumption that a Carrier could pass through a potentially cleared seazone in NCM. (as it actually is legal under LHTR)</em>
	</ul>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<br> <b>Differences due to the New Phase Order</b>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left;">
	<ul>
	<li>Under the New Phase Order (combat movement before purchases), one knows about any air losses occurring during combat movement due to AA fly-overs, prior to the purchase phase.
	<li>Under the New Phase Order, a nation which is able to conquer a COMPLETELY empty enemy capital during combat move, could spend all captured money right away in the same rounds purchase phase.<br><em>It is thus advised to leave one Inf behind if abandoning a capital. Prominent early example is Paris in round 3.</em>
	</ul>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<br><b>Design Notes for this mod</b>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left;">
	<ul>
	<li>The objective of this mod was to provide an alternative for players who may occassionally want a game that plays more quickly and has a slightly more historical feel. The number of players was reduced, the number of types of units was drastically reduced and the number of units in the game was reduced by somewhat reducing the amount of production on the map. Economically the neutral countries are smaller in relation to the major powers, though conquering neutrals is still an important part of the expansion of German power. Militarilly, an effort has been made to more accurately reflect the strength and deployment of the respective armed forces at the start of the war. The Axis are not strong enough to go on the offensive in every direction simultaneously, though the political and military unpreparedness of their adversiaries means they have the opportunity to expand their strength greatly.
	<li>Germany's powerful ground and air forces are massed in the east to quickly conquer Poland. Germany did not have the resources to fight a two-front war against both France and the Soviet Union and will therefore probably be obliged to concentrate on France next (though defending in the West and striking Russia while she is weakest is an interesting strategy). 
	<li>Italy was unprepared for war not only militarily but also politically and economically, simulated by reduced PUs and only one factory at the start of the game. Once France falls Italy can breathe easier but will still probably play a supporting role to Germany, rather than being a full partner. 
	<li>Russia's army is large but lacks offensive punch. Economically Russia was becoming a powerhouse but Stalin's purges and the Red Army's reorganization meant that Soviet military power was at a low ebb in 1939, simulated by no PUs or factories at the start of the game.  
	<li>Isolationist sentiment in the US was strong and it was some time before the US could play a major role in the war in Europe. This reality is simulated by no PUs or factories at the start of the game. US ground and air forces in 1939 were relatively small, but the American economy enabled their rapid expansion. 
	<li>Britain and France began the war with the same strategy which had worked in World War I: Contain Germany and gradually build up Allied forces until it would be possible to go over to the offensive. Economically they were equal to Germany and Italy. But militarily they were unprepared. Once France falls, Britain will need every bit of its naval and economic power to survive. Its small army is in no position to intervene decisively on the continent at the outset and must be gradually expanded as resources allow. 
	<li>France in 1939 was a major power, but the test of combat revealed serious deficiencies in its military, especially in the organization and tactical doctrine of its ground forces. A further handicap was the fractured state of French politics, which hindered rearmament. These factors are simulated by the lack of armored units (though France had a larger, more powerful tank fleet than Germany) and reduced PUs and only one factory at game start. Thus France is unable to mount a serious offensive against Germany or to even keep pace with Germany's military buildup and will soon be totally on the defensive. With time France probably could have corrected its political and military deficiencies. However, a competent German player will not give France that time. France must simply hold on as long as possible.
